# Aliucord plugin repo

This is the repo that stores all officially published and verified aliucord plugins, for both the legacy (java/kotlin) discord app, and the modern (react native) discord app.

The specification for everything about this repository (detailed file explanations, review process, etc) can be found in the [spec folder](spec).

All actual plugin data is stored on the `data` branch, so it can be safely pruned if it ever gets too large.

## Legacy plugins

Legacy plugin data is stored in the `legacy` folder. This is not done yet, as modern is more of a priority.

## Modern plugins

Modern plugin data is stored in the `modern` folder.

## Licensing

As this is just a location to store other people's work, all plugin files uploaded under this repository are licensed under the same license as their respective source code. There is a LICENSE file in every plugin directory, along with the plugin file itself, and the metadata.
