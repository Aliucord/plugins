This is the repository that stores all officially published and verified Aliucord plugins, for both the legacy (
Java/Kotlin) Discord app, and the modern (React Native) Discord app.

The specification for everything about this repository and the internals of publishing plugins can be (detailed
explanations) can be found in the [spec](spec) folder.

All actual plugin data is stored on the `data` branch, so it can be safely pruned if it ever gets too large.
